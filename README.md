# aws.authrss

Access your Plone RSS feeds as authenticated user. This feature was inspired by
[Redmine](http://www.redmine.org/).

## Abstract

Actually, authenticated users in Plone site may read content that are not available to anonymous users. But when subscribing to a Plone RSS feed they can only view items that are available to anonymous users. Just because the RSS readers such as Google Reader do not - and cannot - provide feature to provide authentication cookie or header to authenticate on the feed URL.

`aws.authrss` gives to the authenticated users a dedicated and private link to the Plone RSS feeds. Such feeds provide all elements the user is entitled to view, when authenticated in the Plone site with a browser, and of course,
relevant to the feed (Folder, Collection, ...)

Each user may have a private token he can change whenever he wants in his personal preferences. This token is part of the query string of the authenticated RSS feed, and identifies the user **only** for the RSS feeds.

A control panel for site administrators gives the possibility to prune private
tokens of removed users.

## Plays with

The module supports Plone 6.0

> Conflicts with [collective.blog.feeds](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.blog.feeds) because both override the same viewlet, and there's no possible conflict resolution. Sorry.

## Installation

### Production site


As usual in your ``zc.buildout`` configuration:

```
[instance]
recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
...
eggs =
  aws.authrss
```

### Development site

The development package at Github comes with a suitable `buildout.cfg`. See [Links](#links). You just need to clone that repository and play the usual `python bootstrap.py bin/buildout`.

### In Site Setup

Don't forget to enable syndication in the Syndication control panel
and to check the `Show feed link` checkbox.

### Upgrading

Available upgrades may be executed from the `portal_setup` tool of your Plone site in the **Upgrades** tab.

> No upgrades with alpha releases

> For the first alpha versions, we shall not provide upgrade steps. You will need to reinstall the component. Stable versions coming after the first stable versions will come will all necessary upgrade steps.

## Customization

### Integrators

`aws.authrss` overrides the `portal_actions/document_actions/rss` action to add the authenticated RSS link in your site.

### Developers

`aws.authrss` comes with its own tokens manager that stores tokens in an `OOBtree`. See the class `aws.authrss.tokenmanager.DefaultTokenManager`.

You may provide your own tokens manager registering an utility that implements `aws.authrss.interfaces.ITokenManager` in your component's `override.zcml`. Then install this local utility using a GenericSetup `componentregistry.xml` file like this one:

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<componentregistry>
  <utilities>
    <utility
      interface="aws.authrss.interfaces.ITokenManager"
      factory="my.component.tokenmanager.DefaultTokenManager"
    />
  </utilities>
</componentregistry>
```

## Planned features

Do not assign tokens to users authenticated from an user folder that's not in the Plone site (i.e a Zope root manager).
